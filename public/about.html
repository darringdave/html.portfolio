<h1>About Me - Double D</h1>
<p>In hopes of making a good initial impression, my name is Dave Darrington, and I'm a Web Developer.</p>

<p>I am a fan of many things, and am fascinated by what life has to offer. I love a good laugh, and am a fan of comedy of all kinds. A little about me...there are two reasons why I don't drink toilet water. #1 & #2.</p>

<p>My Sports Teams include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>NFL: The San Francisco 49ers for every second of my life.</li>
  <li>NBA: The Utah Jazz with an honorable mention being the Golden State Warriors.</li>
  <li>MLB: The Oakland/Las Vegas A's.</li>
  <li>MLS: Real Salt Lake (RSL).</li>
  <li>NHL: The soon to be Utah Hockey Team/The Yetis.</li>
  <li>Collegiate: BYU, Stanford and Cal athletics.</li>
</ul>

<p>While I grew up in the Bay Area, I have called Utah my home for the past 20+ years.<p>

</p>I have worked in many interesting fields (Healthcare, Insurance, Software Sales, Solar Sales and Genetic Testing with AI applications), and I hope to to have doors open within the realm of Web Development in the future.</p>
